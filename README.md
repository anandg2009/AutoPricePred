# AutoPricePred

ðŸ”¸Project Overview:
The goal of the project is to predict automobile prices using a variety of machine learning models. The dataset includes several features, such as the car's make, fuel type, number of cylinders, and price, among others.

Key Steps:
1. Data Preprocessing:

â€¢ Initial exploration shows different types of data (object, float, int, bool).
â€¢ The dataset has 16 discrete and 10 continuous columns.
â€¢ Missing values and non-standard values like "?" are handled through preprocessing.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

â€¢ Car Brand Analysis: Toyota has the highest number of listings, while Mercury has the least.
â€¢ Price Analysis: Mercedes-Benz is associated with the highest vehicle prices, while Chevrolet offers vehicles with the highest city miles per gallon (MPG) but at a lower price point.
â€¢ Cylinders and MPG: Vehicles with eight cylinders and cars with the best city MPG were analyzed to derive patterns.

3. Univariate Analysis:

â€¢ Numerical and categorical columns were explored separately to understand the distribution and variability within the data.

4. Model Training:

â€¢ Several machine learning models were trained to predict automobile prices:
â€¢ Linear Regression: Performed well with reasonable accuracy.
â€¢ Support Vector Regression (SVR): Did not perform as expected, with a low RÂ² score.
â€¢ Decision Tree: Showed good performance with minimal overfitting.
â€¢ Bagging and Boosting (Gradient Boosting): Provided strong results, with Gradient Boosting performing particularly well due to its ability to handle non-linear relationships.

5. Challenges:

â€¢ A limited dataset with only 200 rows contributed to overfitting and reduced accuracy.
â€¢ Handling missing values and "?" entries was time-consuming and affected the quality of insights.
â€¢ Lack of features like car model year and sale price year further limited the analysis.
â€¢ Hyperparameter tuning was challenging but essential for improving model performance.

6. Conclusion:

â€¢ Gradient Boosting emerged as the best-performing model, making it well-suited for this task.
â€¢ The project encountered various challenges, especially related to data quality and size.
